# This is the dbuild configuration to build zinc and its dependencies on Scala 2.10.x
#  It is run through the Scala IDE parametrized job: https://jenkins.scala-ide.org:8496/jenkins/job/parameterized-zinc/ 
#  and other uber-build runs.

# There should not be any need to change this file. Except to change the base repositories, most parameters can be modified
# at the uber-build configuration level (check the sbt-publish configuration for examples) or by tweaking the properties file
# (check stepZinc inside the uber-build script).

# This file knows how to build sbt inside Ivy and publish *maven nightly artifacts* for consumption.
# Combined, we run tests to ensure that sanity exists for these artifacts (specifically, does Zinc build/run).
# This build is *tied* to the 2.10.x scala series.  Scala's modularization requires different build files for
# both 2.10.x and 2.11.x series.  The main difference is in how modules are grabbed.
# The four projects that are sbt related are:
#
# - harrah/sbinary     * Dependency required for building sbt/sbt
# - sbt/sbt            * Build/Test/Deploys via Ivy
# - sbt/sbt-republish  * Actually releases maven artifacts
# - typesafehub/zinc   * for testing only


# If you'd like to create a "branch release" of this build, here's what you need to do:
# - Copy the sbt-on-2.10.x.properties file to a new name.
# - Override the variables in there for your purposes.
# - Create a new jenkins job where the environment variable SBT_TAG_PROPS points at your properties file.
# - Test locally with the command `SBT_VERSION_PROPERTIES_FILE=file:my.properties ./bin/dbuild sbt-on-2.10.x`
